Performed robot arm image segmentation from multiple viewpoints using NVIDIA SegFormer (mit-b2) model. Enhanced model generalization performance with 9,132 image-mask pairs and 3-level data augmentation. Achieved Pixel Accuracy 99.78%, Mean IoU 98.57%, and Mean Dice 99.28% through 48 epochs of training. Secured practical precision by removing original mask noise and predicting smooth boundaries. Implemented a real-time robot vision solution with balanced performance and speed using the mit-b2 model.
